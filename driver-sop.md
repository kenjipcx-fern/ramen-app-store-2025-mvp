# Driver SOP â€” Ramen App Store (MVP)

Purpose
Ensure safe transport and quality preservation for ramen deliveries.

Applies to
- Third-party couriers (DoorDash/Uber) and any manual dispatch fallback

Pickup
- [ ] Announce order number and show app screen at counter
- [ ] Confirm SEAL CODE on bag matches app screen
- [ ] Verify tamper seals intact on all containers and outer bag
- [ ] Confirm thermal bag present and ready before handoff
- [ ] Photo: take clear photo of sealed outer bag (required)
- [ ] Scan QR/SEAL CODE in app (chain of custody)

Handling
- [ ] Keep broth containers upright at all times (place at base of thermal bag)
- [ ] Do not stack heavy items on broth container
- [ ] Maintain thermal bag closed except during insertion/removal
- [ ] If multiple orders: keep ramen order isolated from spill-prone items

Spill-check prompt (in-app)
- [ ] Confirm upright broth and sealed noodles
- [ ] If concern: add photo and note; notify support via app

Navigation
- [ ] Use in-app navigation; avoid hard braking and aggressive turns
- [ ] If running late (>10 min beyond ETA), send customer message via app

Drop-off
- [ ] Follow delivery instructions; respect privacy (masked number)
- [ ] Leave at door if specified; photo proof clearly showing bag and door/number
- [ ] Do not open sealed bag
- [ ] Mark delivered in app immediately; ensure location captured

Edge cases
- Seal broken at pickup: ask restaurant to re-seal; do not accept otherwise
- Suspected spill: request repack; log photo; contact support
- Customer unreachable: follow app protocol (call/message/wait) and policies

Safety & conduct
- Follow traffic laws; no texting while driving
- Be courteous; avoid discussing order issues beyond app guidance

Metrics captured
- Pickup photo; proof-of-delivery photo; timestamps; spill-check responses

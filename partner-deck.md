# Ramen App Store — MVP Partner Deck (Outline)

Slide 1 — Title
- Ramen App Store: Deliver the exact bowl, hot and textured right
- MVP Pilot — SF Bay Area

Slide 2 — Problem
- General delivery apps degrade ramen quality (soggy noodles, lukewarm broth)
- Menus lack ramen-specific options; reviews don’t reflect ramen quality
- Restaurants & drivers lack ramen-aware workflows

Slide 3 — Solution
- Ramen-first customization (firmness, broth, spice, toppings constraints)
- Ramen-aware logistics (separation guidance, heat-retention, tuned pickups)
- Ramen-specific facet reviews (broth depth, noodle texture on arrival)

Slide 4 — Why Now
- Delivery-first habits; niche marketplaces winning
- Tech readiness for ramen-aware flows (menu constraints, logistics signals)

Slide 5 — MVP Scope
- Customer: discovery, customization, fast checkout, live tracking, facet reviews
- Restaurant: menu/inventory, KDS/queue, packaging notes, throttle
- Driver: offer handling, pickup verification, delivery proof

Slide 6 — How It Works
- Separation by default for delivery orders; ramen-aware batching
- Accurate ETAs; pickup window targets; hot-bag compliance

Slide 7 — For Restaurants
- Higher conversion/AOV via better customization & packaging SOPs
- Fewer refunds from quality preservation and clear expectations

Slide 8 — For Drivers
- Predictable windows & earnings; simple SOP with verification

Slide 9 — Metrics & SLAs
- Conversion, reorder rate, noodle-texture facet, ETA error, pickup lateness
- Targets: p90 ETA error ≤ ±6m; pickup ≤10m; noodle texture ≥ 4.3/5

Slide 10 — Pilot Plan
- Weeks 1–2 Foundations/Discovery; 3–4 Menu/Checkout/Orders; 5–6 Driver/Portal/Reviews → Pilot
- Restaurant packaging SOP & training; driver hot-bag verification

Slide 11 — What We Need
- Menus/photos; packaging SOP commitment; pickup readiness
- Driver compliance; courier partner integration

Slide 12 — Call to Action
- Join the pilot: share location, hours, packaging capabilities, menu assets

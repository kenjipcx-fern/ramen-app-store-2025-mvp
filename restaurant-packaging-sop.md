# Restaurant Packaging SOP — Ramen App Store (MVP)

Purpose
Ensure ramen quality survives delivery through consistent packaging, sealing, and handoff.

Applies to
- All ramen items; special handling for tsukemen

Prep checklist (line cook)
- [ ] Confirm order ticket, item list, customizations
- [ ] Prepare broth to spec; measure temp immediately before packing (target >70°C / 158°F)
- [ ] Cook noodles to requested firmness; drain thoroughly (≥10s) to reduce carryover softening
- [ ] Separate packaging: broth in sealed thermal container; noodles in vented container; toppings in dry container(s)
- [ ] Tsukemen: pack noodles cold (or room temp per recipe), broth extra hot; include dip cup lid fit check
- [ ] Allergen separation: use fresh gloves; separate tools if necessary

Packaging checklist (expeditor)
- [ ] Label each container with item name + modifiers (firmness/spice/oil), and order short code
- [ ] Add oil/sauce packets and utensils as configured by customer
- [ ] Place absorbent liner at base of delivery bag; upright broth container only
- [ ] Apply tamper-evident seal to each container and to outer bag
- [ ] Insert printed checklist and reheat/assembly instructions (if applicable)
- [ ] Apply seal/QR label with system-generated SEAL CODE
- [ ] Mark packaging surcharge on receipt when applicable

Thermal handling
- [ ] Use dedicated thermal bag/sleeve for broth containers
- [ ] Do not stack heavy items on broth container; maintain upright orientation
- [ ] Minimize dwell time on hot line; handoff within 2 minutes of seal

Handoff (front-of-house)
- [ ] Verify order number and SEAL CODE on ticket matches label
- [ ] Confirm driver thermal bag present (visual check)
- [ ] Capture pickup scan (QR/SEAL CODE) and take photo of sealed bag in system
- [ ] Provide pickup instructions and any gate/parking info if requested

Exceptions & notes
- If temp <70°C at seal: reheat broth and re-measure
- If container damage/leak test fails: repack and re-seal
- If items 86’d: coordinate substitution or cancel per policy; update system

Metrics logged automatically

# Ramen App Store — Product Specifications (v1.0, MVP Locked)

Task ID: ramen-app-store-2024

## 1) Problem Statement
Ramen lovers struggle to discover and order high-quality ramen that survives delivery without losing texture, heat, and flavor integrity. General food apps do not understand ramen’s assembly constraints (noodle sogginess, broth temperature, toppings moisture), leading to disappointing bowls and low repeat orders.

Why now: Post-pandemic delivery normalization + proliferation of ghost kitchens; ramen popularity rising; packaging tech improved.

Product promise: For ramen lovers, get the exact bowl you crave, delivered hot and textured right, with ramen-aware packaging and logistics.

Goals (MVP)
- Increase “good texture on arrival” rate to ≥85% (self-reported post-delivery facet)
- ETA accuracy p90 error ≤6 minutes; median delivery ≤35 minutes
- Reduce “soggy noodles” complaints by ≥60% vs. baseline from comparable apps in pilot

Final Decisions (MVP locked)
- Launch market: SF Bay Area (English)
- Delivery: Third-party dispatch (DoorDash Drive primary, Uber Direct fallback). No in-house driver app for MVP
- Customer platforms: iOS + Web PWA. Restaurant: Web portal. Driver: third-party only
- Payments: Stripe (Cards, Apple Pay, Google Pay), USD
- Packaging: Broth/noodle separation default ON ($0.75 surcharge, +3 min prep; waived for pickup; restaurant can subsidize)
- SLAs: Pickup ≤10 min from accept; ETA p90 error ≤6 min; median delivery ≤35 min
- Refund policy: Auto-credit $5 or 20% (whichever higher) for minor quality defects; full refund for spill/undelivered; late >15 min beyond ETA triggers 15% credit; abuse detection flags

Success Metrics & Guardrails
- Repeat rate 30-day ≥35%; NPS ≥45
- Facet satisfaction averages (heat ≥4.3/5, firmness ≥4.2/5)
- Order defect rate (spill/soggy/late) ≤3% of delivered orders
- Refund issuance ≤6% of GMV with downward trend post-month 2

## 2) Personas & Jobs-To-Be-Done
